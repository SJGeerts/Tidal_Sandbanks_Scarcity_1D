# Tidal_Sandbanks_Scarcity_1D
MATLAB code for "Semi-implicit time integration of the Exner equation for bedload transport over a non-erodible layer: Application to a tidal sandbank model".

### Instructions
Code file `main.m` is the main file to run, it will read out the specified input file. Currently, a test case is enabled only, which quickly indicates whether the code is functioning properly. All model runs used in the manuscript can be generated by un-commenting line number 23 in `main.m`. In this code, models_to_run specifies the models that will be run with main, it can be any, or multiple from the specified input file

Code file `set_figure.m` only needs to be run once when starting up matlab.
